# Introduction

This project has not yet been created. In my final year of Software Engineering I will be doing a capstone project with a few other students. We will be spending two semesters creating a video game of some description and upon completion I will upload all of the appropriate files/information to this page. I am very excited to spenda greater portion of time creating a larger scale game than I ever have before.
