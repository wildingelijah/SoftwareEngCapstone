# Introduction

This project is currently in progress. As I am in my final year of Software Engineering I am doing a capstone project with four other students. We are going to be spending two semesters creating a video game which we have titled: UnderGods, and upon completion I will upload all of the appropriate files/information to this page. I am very excited to spend a greater portion of time creating a larger scale game than I ever have before.

## About The Project

Title: UnderGods  
Genre: Strategy/4X  
Developers: Elijah Wilding, Nathan Coit, Sullivan Stobo, Harrison Lau and Zack Palantzas.  

There are two main modes in our game: management mode and combat mode. Nathan and I are completely responsbile for everything surrounding management mode. Sully and Harri are responsible for combat mode while Zack is doing all of the art assets.
