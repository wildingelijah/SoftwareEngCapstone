# Introduction

This project is complete. As I have completed my final year of Software Engineering I also completed a capstone project with four other students. We spent two semesters creating a video game which we have titled: UnderGods, and now that it has been completed all of the appropriate files/information are available on this page. This was a huge learning experience. Creating a game from start to finish has been one of the most fun and interesting projects I have ever had the privilege of working on.

## About The Project

Title: UnderGods  
Genre: Strategy/4X  
Developers: Elijah Wilding, Nathan Coit, Sullivan Stobo, Harrison Lau and Zack Palantzas.  

There are two main modes in our game: management mode and combat mode. Nathan and I are completely responsbile for everything surrounding management mode. Sully and Harri are responsible for combat mode while Zack is doing all of the art assets. We drew inspiration from the likes of Civilization, Fire Emblem and multiple other games under the same genre.
